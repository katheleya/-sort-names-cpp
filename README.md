# -sort-names-cpp
C++ Name Sorting Program
This repository contains a solution for a C++ internship task. The program sorts a list of names, checks for duplicates, validates input, and allows searching by name or position. It is developed using the newer version of Dev C++ Embarcadero C++.

Files:
sortNames.cpp — The main program
README.md — Project explanation
README.txt — Example output of the program

What the Program Does:
Reads a list of names from the user.
Stores names in a std::vector<std::string>.
Sorts names in ascending order (A → Z).
Prevents empty or invalid names.
Ensures no duplicate names (case-insensitive).
Allows searching by name or position in the sorted list.
Supports multiple sessions, letting users restart and enter new lists.
